The civil rights foot soldiers were the grassroots activists and ordinary individuals who played a crucial role in the American civil rights movement during the 1950 and 1960. They were the backbone of the movement, actively participating in protests, demonstrations, marches, sit-ins and other nonviolent actions to advocate for racial equality and social justice.

The Civil Rights Foot Soldiers were the grassroots activists and ordinary individuals who played a crucial role in the American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s. They were the backbone of the movement, actively participating in protests, demonstrations, marches, sit-ins and other nonviolent actions to advocate for racial equality and social justice.\

In this podcast episode, we explore the importance of incorporating music and story time into early childhood development. The benefits of music and storytelling for children's cognitive, emotional, and social development are overwhelming. 

We feature examples of songs that are popular with young children because we believe storytelling can help children develop empathy, emotional intelligence and critical thinking skills. 

In the final segment of the episode, we dive into the life and legacy of Joseph Bologne, also known as Chevalier de Saint-Georges. Bologna was born in the French colony of Guadeloupe in 1745, the son of a wealthy plantation owner and his enslaved mistress. Despite facing discrimination due to his mixed race, Bologne excelled as a musician and became a renowned composer, violinist and conductor in 18th-century Europe.

We explore Bologne’s early years in Guadeloupe, his education in France and his rise to fame as a musical prodigy. We also delve into Bologne’s role as a cultural figure in pre-revolutionary France, where he was a favorite of Queen Marie Antoinette and a prominent member of the Parisian social scene. Despite facing racism and discrimination throughout his life, Bologna preservered and broke down barriers in the classical music world, paving the way for future generations of Black musicians.

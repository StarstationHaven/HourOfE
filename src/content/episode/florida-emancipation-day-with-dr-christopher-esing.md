Historian Dr. Christopher M. Esing discusses Florida Emancipation Day. 

Florida Emancipation Day is celebrated annually on May 20, commemorating the proclamation of emancipation in Tallahassee on that date in 1865. This date marks the end of slavery in Florida, eleven days after the Civil War ended and two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. 

Happy Emancipation Day, Lake City and Columbia County, FL. 2025. Celebrating 160 Years of Freedom.

Many enslaved African Americans in Columbia County, upon being set free, married in mass. Weddings for those who were enslaved were generally only recognized on the plantation and not in the legal system, so 25 couples took the chance to legally become husband and wife. A Justice of the Peace in Gainesville named Fryer offered to wed all freedmen, and a group from Columbia County went to his home. He provided a barrel of free lemonade and refreshments. The newlyweds danced and partied all night long at the judge’s house because of the distance they had to travel.

Their wedding day offered local freedmen their first real taste of freedom. ~ Florida Emancipation Day with Dr. Christopher M. Esing.

In this podcast, we will talk about an important topic that affects many children and young people: mental health. Mental health is all about how we think, feel, and behave. It is just as important as physical health and can affect every aspect of our lives.

We will discuss some common mental health challenges that children and young people may face.

We will also talk about some ways to cope with these challenges and how to seek help if needed.

It is important to remember that seeking help for mental health challenges is not a sign of weakness, and it is nothing to be ashamed of. There are many people who can help, such as parents, teachers, school counselors, and mental health professionals.
